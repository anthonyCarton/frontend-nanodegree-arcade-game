===============================

## Rubric
Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

## Instructions
For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## Gameplay
The game begins when the page loads, and resets automatically when the player wins or loses.

## Resources
### Switch Statements vs. Object Literals
Instead of switch statements, I am using object literals based on [Todd Motto's article Replacing switch statements with Object literals](https://toddmotto.com/deprecating-the-switch-statement-for-object-literals/).

### Collision Detection methods
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) has a great explanation of collision detection, and I used the [Circle Collision method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/2D_collision_detection) to detect collision between player and enemy.
